# Rule-Search-Engine-with-AST

1.Flask Application Setup:
The code snippet initializes a Flask application instance named app using Flask(__name__).
2.It imports necessary modules like Flask, request, and jsonify from Flask, and functions create_rule, combine_rules, and evaluate_rule from the rule_engine module.
API Endpoints:
3.Three endpoints are defined: /create_rule, /combine_rules, and /evaluate_rule, each accepting POST requests.
4.The /create_rule endpoint parses incoming JSON data to create a new rule, stores the rule AST in the rule_asts dictionary, and returns a JSON response with a success message and the rule_id.
5.The /combine_rules endpoint combines multiple rules based on the provided rule_ids and an optional operator, then responds with a success message.
6.The /evaluate_rule endpoint evaluates a rule against provided attributes, retrieves the rule AST based on the rule_id, and returns the evaluation result in a JSON response.
In-Memory Storage for ASTs:
7.The code snippet utilizes an in-memory dictionary rule_asts to store Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) generated for rules.
Execution:
8.The conditional check if __name__ == '__main__': ensures that the Flask application runs when the script is executed directly.
9.The application runs in debug mode (app.run(debug=True)) for easier development and debugging.
Functionality:
10.The code snippet demonstrates a RESTful API implementation for rule management, allowing users to create, combine, and evaluate rules efficiently.
11.It follows the best practice of separating endpoint logic into individual functions for creating, combining, and evaluating rules, enhancing code readability and maintainability.

rule_engine.py contains functions to create, combine, and evaluate rule Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) based on rule strings and user data.
Functionality:
The file provides functions to:
Create a rule AST from a rule string using Python's ast module.
Combine multiple rule ASTs into one using specified logical operators (AND/OR).
Evaluate the rule AST against user data to determine if the conditions are met.
Usage:
Users can utilize the functions in this file to define complex rules, combine them, and evaluate them against data to make decisions or filter results.
Dependencies:
The file imports ast for parsing Python code into ASTs and ASTNode from an external module for creating AST nodes.
Example:
An example use case could be defining rules like "age > 18 AND gender = 'Male'", combining multiple rules like rule1 AND rule2 OR rule3, and evaluating these rules against a dictionary of user data to determine if they meet the conditions.

File Name and Purpose:
The file is named db_schema.py.
It likely contains a Python dictionary representing a database schema or a specific rule within the database schema.
Data Structure:
The main data structure in the file is a nested dictionary.
The dictionary contains keys like _id, name, and AST (Abstract Syntax Tree).
The AST key holds a complex nested structure representing a logical rule.
Rule Description:
The rule is named "Age and Department Rule".
It consists of a combination of logical operators (AND, OR) and operands (conditions).
The rule is structured using nested operators to define conditions based on age, department, salary, and experience.
Logical Structure:
The rule uses logical operators like AND and OR to combine conditions.
Conditions are defined using operands like age > 30, department = 'Sales', salary > 50000, and experience > 5.
Nested operators and operands create a hierarchical structure to represent the rule's logic.
Potential Use:
This file may be part of a larger system that processes or evaluates rules based on the defined schema.
It could be used for implementing rule-based logic in a database system, validation rules, or any other scenario where complex conditions need to be evaluated.
